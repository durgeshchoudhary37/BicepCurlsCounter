# BicepCurlsCounter

Computer Vision - Real-time recurrence monitor for bicep curls || Self Project

•	Developed a graphical user interface using Tkinter that enables users to count the number of repetitions they complete throughout an exercise in real-time.
•	Deployed cv2 (OpenCV) and PIL (Python Imaging Library) for computer vision tasks: capturing frames from a camera, image processing and manipulation.
•	Implementation that trains a Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) using grayscale images and predicts the exercise class based on the processed frame.
•	Performs exercise prediction using a custom model, and provides functionality for counting and saving frames for training the model.
